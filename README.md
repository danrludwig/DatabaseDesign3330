# DatabaseDesign3330
Final group project for Database Management (3330)

Project Description:
Madison Apartments is based in CokeVille, Indiana. In the three years since its 
creation, Madison Apartmentâ€™s Manager (you) has been tracking most ofthe information 
about the apartment complex in an Excel workbook. As the apartment complex grows, 
the need to implement more advanced business practices is heightened. The Excel 
workbook has been working fine;however, it lacks away for you tosufficiently organize 
large amounts of data and run reports about your apartment complex.Being a 
forward-thinking business manager, you want to establish a relational database to 
track and run reports about various components ofyour apartment complex(and 
potentially use the database to support a future web application). For example, 
you are wantingto generate email lists, find which tenants are in which building,
find whichapartments are not at max capacity,track which tenants have been assigned 
a resident assistant, and a myriadof other tasksthat are currently not efficient. 
In order to centralize all your data in an efficient and adaptablemanner, you are on 
a quest to design a relational database structure to store information for easy 
tracking and processing. Luckily, you have chosen twoother project group members to 
help you in this endeavor.
